# Matplotlib_Pandas_Challenge
249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

### This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:
- Prepare the data.
- Generate summary statistics.
- Create bar charts and pie charts.
- Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
- Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
- Calculate correlation and regression.
- Final analysis.

#### Analysis¶
- A generated pie plot shows an almost equal distribution of female versus male mice 51% - male, 49% - female.
- A boxplot was created for drugs "Capomulin", "Ramicane", "Infubinol", "Ceftamin". Only Infubinol has an outlier. "Capomulin" and "Ramicane" were more effective, their boxes are loacted lower than the boxes of "Infubinol", "Ceftamin.
- A line plot "Capomulin treatmnet of mouse I509" shows that the drug has positive effect on a mouse over the time period. A tumor volume decreased.
- The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume for the "Capomulin" regimen is 0.84. There is a strong relationship between mouse weight and the average tumor volume.
